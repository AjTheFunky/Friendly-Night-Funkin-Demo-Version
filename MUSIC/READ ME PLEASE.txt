okay so this mod has been in the works for a while and it's not even done yet
in that time i migrated from Soundtrap to FL Studio
I can't open source the soundtrap projects, i'm sorry
The songs that were made in soundtrap are
Playable Songs:
-Learning
-Beep
-Tinkering
-Electrify
-Haunted
-Purgatory
-Afterlife
-Grape Boy
-Party
-Veronica
(the tetris inst being only beatboxing was made in audacity)

Dialogue Music:
-Aoki's Theme
-Aoki's Theme (sick)
-Veronica's Theme

Others:
-Hey! (Main menu)
-Snack Time (Pause)
-Tripped (Game Over)

as you can see it's basically almost the entire demo
there isn't really anything i can do except give out the stems for those songs
and not so fun fact, soundtrap doesn't save beginning silence and just cuts straight to the audio for some reason
yippee /s

as for the midis and usts
some of the songs have cut and pasted parts so you'll have to do that too

i allow betadcius on youtube (no other music platforms) with monetization i'm not a dummy lol
go wild

if you cover my songs in your mods please credit me
